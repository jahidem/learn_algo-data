/***********************************************************************************
 The idea behind bigmod is simple.
Let's assume, the desired remainder is x.
Then we want to determine a^b = x (mod m)
we can do it by calulating a%m and multiplying it b times and mod it every time to get the answer

(a^b)%m = ( (a%m) * (a%m) * ......... (a%m) )%m         [Time Complexity O(b)]
                          -----------------------------------------
                                                 |
                                          b times

But in this code's function we used a more time efficient approach.
That is instead of taking b times a%m , we can divide the b in little parts which we can
easily determine,
We will divide b to it's binary representation.
Let's assume b=25
Then we can divide b into these parts,

25 =  11001
25 = 16*1 + 8*1 + 4*0 + 2*0 + 1*1

So, now we can determine (a^25)%m easily,
(a^25)%m = (a^16)%m * (a^8)%m * (a^1)%m

Now, we can take a%m in a variable and keep multiplying by itself by itself,

Thus , rem = (a^1)%m
              rem = (rem * rem)%m = (a^2)%m
              rem = (rem * rem)%m = (a^4)%m
              rem = (rem * rem)%m = (a^8)%m
            .
            .
            .

Now we use the idea how we use to determine the binary representation of a number.
We will divide  the number by two, if it was an odd then the last digit would be 1 ,
in other case it will be 0.
So, when we will found b as odd we will multiply the rem with the answer.
When b becomes 0, then the loop will break and we will get the answer.

The time complexity of this process would be O(log b).
